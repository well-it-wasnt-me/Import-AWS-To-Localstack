## Features

- **Clone S3 Buckets**: Because who wants to manually copy buckets? Not you.
- **Clone EC2 Instances**: Even the ones with weird names like `prod-ec2-007`.
- **Clone Lambda Functions**: Functions that actually do stuff, not just `hello world`.
- **Clone SQS Queues**: Get those messages flowing.
- **Clone Cognito IdP**: Get your users.
- **Clone DynamoDB and Data**: Get your Dynamo Data.
- **Clone RDS and Data**: Get your RDS Data.
- **Progress Bar**: Because watching progress bars is more satisfying than watching paint dry.
- **Logging**: In case something goes wrong, you'll know who to blame.
- **Command-Line Interface**: For those who like to type their way to success.
- **Docker Management**: Spins up LocalStack so fast, you'll think it's on caffeine.

## Working on...
[x] **ERROR** - ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the CreateFunction operation: Your access has been denied by S3, please make sure your request credentials have permission to GetObject for localstack-bucket/file-path.ext. S3 Error Code: AccessDenied. S3 Error Message: Access Denied in function: function-full-name
[] **BOTO/AWS-CLI** I know, i know...some stuff use aws-cli other boto...planning to switch entirely towards boto soon.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (If you don't have this, you're probably still using dial-up)
- AWS CLI configured (because who has time for manual API calls?)
- Docker (to keep all the techy stuff contained)
- LocalStack PRO Account (for a local AWS sandbox)
- LocalStack Auth Token

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/well-it-wasnt-me/Import-AWS-To-Localstack.git
    cd Import-AWS-To-Localstack
    ```
   
2. Copy: .env.dist to .env and update docker-compose.yml as well with your datas
   1. .env.dist to .env and update the values according to your needs
   2. docker-compose.yml-dist to docker-compose.yml and update the values according to your needs  


3. Start venv and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv localstack-env
    source localstack-env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Make sure Docker is running. If not, give it a nudge or a kick.

## Usage

You can run this script in two fabulous ways:

### Interactive Mode

Just run the script without any arguments and follow the prompts. It's easier than getting through a TSA checkpoint.

```bash
python import_aws_to_localstack.py
```

### Command Line Mode
For those who love command-line arguments more than coffee:

- Clone EVERYTHING

```bash
python import_aws_to_localstack.py
```

- Clone EVERYTHING but filter by name and service
```bash
python import_aws_to_localstack.py --services s3 lambda --specific "prod-"
```

## Configuration
Want to filter resources by name? Just provide the --specific argument and type away. It'll filter like a pro.

### Example

Here's how to clone all your AWS resources containing the name "dev":

```bash
python import_aws_to_localstack.py --all --specific "dev"
```

Sit back, watch the progress bars, and enjoy your favorite beverage while the script does its magic.

## Troubleshooting
- **AWS Credentials Error**: Make sure your AWS CLI is configured. If it's not, it might be time to call tech support.
- **Docker Not Running**: Start Docker. Seriously, it's not going to start itself.
- **Other Errors**: Check the logs. They might be more interesting than you think.
